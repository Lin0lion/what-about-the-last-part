# what-about-the-last-part
What About The Last Part is a Minecraft modpack about adding more to the end-game, rather than it just being a case of "kill ender dragon, kill wither, kill warden, build cool base, bored".
It contains a bit of **custom** content (via KubeJS).

(The README will be updated soon.)
